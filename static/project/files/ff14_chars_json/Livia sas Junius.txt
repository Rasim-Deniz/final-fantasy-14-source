'''Livia sas Junius''' is a major antagonist in ''[[Final Fantasy XIV|Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn]]''. She hold the rank of tribunus angusticlavius in the [[XIVth Imperial Legion]] of the [[Garlean Empire]], and acts as the third-in-command to legatus [[Gaius van Baelsar]].

==History==
[[File:FFXIV Imperial Legatus.png|thumb|Livia and her fellow officers with Gaius.]]
Having been orphaned in a war and separated from her sister [[Lucia goe Junius|Lucia]], Livia sas Junius was taken in and raised by Gaius van Baelsar. Livia seeks to repay Gaius for his kindness by joining his new [[Garlean campaign|campaign to continue the empire's subjugation of Eorzea]] in the aftermath of the [[Seventh Umbral Era]]. After the Barheim incident, in which scores of imperial colonists met their end at the hands of the natives, Livia was dispatched to Dalmasca. Under her watch, suspected rebels were hunted down and slaughtered without trial.

She confronts Nero tol Scaeva for straying from his assigned duties to spy on the [[Warrior of Light (Final Fantasy XIV)|Warrior of Light]] slaying [[Ifrit (Final Fantasy XIV)|Ifrit]], and threatens to execute him herself if he lets himself fail. Nero remarks it would be foolish of him to confront a woman in love.

[[File:Livia vs Minfilia.jpg|thumb|left|Livia pointing her gun at Minfilia.]]
Livia leads the legion's attack on the hideout of the [[Scions of the Seventh Dawn]] in Vesper Bay. She kills most of the organization's members after [[Minfilia Warde]]'s formal surrender and kidnaps her, [[Urianger Augurelt]], [[Papalymo Totolymo]], and [[Tataru Taru]], dealing a large blow to those fighting back against the Garleans and the [[primal]] threat.

She oversees the interrogation of Minfilia herself, brutally beating her, demanding information on the [[Echo (Final Fantasy XIV)|Echo]] and how it lets her resist the tempering of the primals. Livia later confronts the Warrior of Light and gets into a battle with [[Yda Hext]] when they break into the imperial stronghold to save Minfilia and the others.

Disturbed by the death of her comrade [[Rhitahtyn sas Arvina]], Livia's psyche begins to unravel and Gaius orders her to defend Castrum Meridianum after the two rendezvous in his quarters.

{{Quote|No... <sob> It's happening...all over again... Please... I cannot bear it... <sob> Don't take him...away from me... My lord Gaius!!!|Livia upon being defeated}}
[[File:Livia Magitek Armor.jpg|thumb|Livia on her custom Magitek Armor.]]
At the end of [[Castrum Meridianum Baileys]], Livia is intent on preventing the Warrior of Light from continuing to [[the Praetorium]]. She starts off piloting a suit of [[Magitek Armor]], but eventually discards the machine and fights the party on the ground using her gunbaghnakhs. She is defeated and left to die as she cries out for her lord.

When the Warrior later ventures into the Aetherical Sea to find Hydaelyn, they encounter Livia manifested as monstrous being.

==Characteristics==
===Appearance===
[[File:Livia sas Junius FFXIV Art.jpg|thumb|125px|Artwork of Livia's helmet.]]
Livia is a woman in a suit of an imperial officer's black and white armor. She wears a unique helmet that bears the visage of a one-eyed woman. She wields a pair of gunbaghnakhs called ''Aglaea'' that have been welded to her armor.

===Personality===
Vicious, cruel and unstable, she takes delight in the domination of [[Eorzea]] and harbors little love for her fellow soldiers, often issuing death threats to them whether they are rank and file soldiers or even of a higher rank than her, such as [[Nero tol Scaeva]]. Her affection is reserved for the man she loves, [[Gaius van Baelsar]], whom she serves with loyalty bordering on fanaticism. She would even ensure that Gaius's adoptive children would keep their distance from him, as even the slightest form of affection towards him from the other orphans would make her jealous.

==Gameplay==
